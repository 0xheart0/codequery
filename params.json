The latest git version (HEAD on master branch) can be used.\r\n\r\nPlease read [NEWS](https://github.com/ruben2020/codequery/blob/master/NEWS.txt) to find out more.\r\n\r\n## How is it different from cscope and ctags? What are the advantages?\r\n\r\nBoth cscope and ctags can do symbol lookup and identify functions, macros, classes and structs.\r\n\r\ncscope is very C-centric, but is fuzzy enough to cover C++ and Java, but not very well for e.g. it doesn't understand destructors and class member instantiations. It can't provide relationships of class inheritance and membership. cscope can do \"functions that call this function\" and \"functions called by this function\". This is a very powerful feature that makes cscope stand out among comparable tools.\r\n\r\nctags does many languages well and understands destructors, member instantiations, and the relationships of class membership and inheritance. From ctags, we can find out \"members and methods of this class\", \"class which owns this member or method\", \"parent of this class\", \"child of this class\" etc. However, it doesn't do \"functions that call this function\" or \"functions called by this function\".\r\n\r\nSo both these tools have their pros and cons, but complement each other.\r\n\r\nCodeQuery is a project that attempts to combine the features available from both cscope and ctags, provide faster database access compared to cscope (because it uses sqlite) and provides a nice GUI tool as well. Due to this faster database access, fast auto-completion of search terms and multiple complex queries to perform visualization is possible.\r\n\r\n## What features does CodeQuery have?\r\n\r\n* Combines the best of both cscope and ctags\r\n* Faster due to the use of sqlite for the CodeQuery database\r\n* Cross-platform GUI tool\r\n* Fast auto-completion of search term\r\n* Case-insensitive, partial keyword search - wildcard search supported * and ?\r\n* Exact match search\r\n* File viewer with syntax highlighting\r\n* Ability to open viewed file in an external editor or IDE\r\n* Visualization of function call graph and class inheritance based on search term\r\n* Visualization graphs can be saved to PNG or Graphviz DOT files\r\n\r\n\r\n## What types of query can I make?\r\n\r\n* Symbol\r\n* Function or macro\r\n* Class or struct\r\n* Functions calling this function\r\n* Functions called by this function\r\n* Class which owns this member or method\r\n* Members and methods of this class\r\n* Parent of this class (inheritance)\r\n* Children of this class (inheritance)\r\n* Files including this file\r\n* Full path for file\r\n\r\n\r\n## What does it look like?\r\n\r\n![CodeQuery screenshot](https://raw.github.com/ruben2020/codequery/master/doc/screenshot.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## How does the visualization look like?\r\n\r\nHere's a function call graph based on the search term of \"updateFilePathLabel\". A -> B means A calls B:    \r\n![Visualization screenshot](https://raw.github.com/ruben2020/codequery/master/doc/screenshot2.png)\r\n\r\n\r\n## What does it cost?
